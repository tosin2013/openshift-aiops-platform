# OpenShift Client Installation via Tarball
# This method bypasses RHSM and installs oc/kubectl from official tarballs
# Reference: https://github.com/tosin2013/ansible-execution-environment

# Option 1: Use stable stream (recommended for production)
OC_VERSION=stable-4.18

# Option 2: Pin to exact version (uncomment to use)
# OC_VERSION=4.18.21

# Option 3: Use direct URL (uncomment to use)
# OC_URL=https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.18.21/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz

# Notes:
# - This installs oc and kubectl to /usr/local/bin
# - Symlinks are created in /usr/bin for compatibility
# - No RHSM entitlements required
# - Filters openshift-clients RPM from bindep to prevent build failures
