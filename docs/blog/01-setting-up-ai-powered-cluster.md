## Platform Architecture Overview

Before we begin, it's important to understand the platform's architecture and the languages used:

### Language Separation

The platform uses **two languages** for different purposes:

| Component | Language | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Jupyter Notebooks** | Python | ML model training, data analysis, experimentation |
| **Coordination Engine** | Go | Production orchestration, remediation, KServe proxy |
| **MCP Server** | Go | OpenShift Lightspeed integration, cluster tooling |
| **KServe Models** | Python (sklearn/PyTorch) | ML inference (served by KServe runtime) |

### How They Work Together

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Jupyter Notebooks │  ← Python (you write this)
│  (Python)           │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ HTTP REST API
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│ Coordination Engine │────▶│   KServe Models     │
│ (Go Service)        │     │ (Python models)     │
└──────────┬──────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   MCP Server        │
│ (Go Service)        │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ OpenShift Lightspeed│
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **You write Python** in notebooks for ML/data science
- ✅ **Go services handle** production orchestration and integration
- ✅ **Python notebooks call Go services** via REST APIs (no Go code needed!)
- ✅ **KServe serves Python models** (sklearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) in production

This separation allows Python's rich ML ecosystem while Go handles Kubernetes integration and performance.

## Step 1: Access the Self-Healing Workbench

The platform provides a Jupyter workbench pre-configured with all necessary tools and libraries.

### Option A: Via OpenShift Console

1. Navigate to **OpenShift AI** → **Data Science Projects**
2. Select the **self-healing-platform** project
3. Click **Launch Notebook**
4. The workbench opens in your browser

### Option B: Via Port Forward

```bash
# Get the workbench pod name
oc get pods -n self-healing-platform | grep workbench

# Port forward to localhost
oc port-forward self-healing-workbench-0 8888:8888 -n self-healing-platform

# Open http://localhost:8888 in your browser
```

---

## Step 2: Run Platform Readiness Validation

The platform includes a comprehensive validation notebook that checks all infrastructure components.

### Open the Validation Notebook

1. In the Jupyter workbench, navigate to `notebooks/00-setup/`
2. Open `00-platform-readiness-validation.ipynb`
3. This notebook performs **35+ validation checks** across:
   - Basic environment (Python, PyTorch, GPU, storage)
   - Platform infrastructure (Coordination Engine, MCP Server)
   - OpenShift components (operators, RBAC, network policies)
   - Network connectivity (Prometheus, KServe, object storage)

### Execute the Validation

Run all cells in the notebook. You'll see output like:

```
📦 VALIDATING BASIC ENVIRONMENT
✅ Python 3.11.0 detected
✅ PyTorch 2.1.0 installed
✅ GPU available: NVIDIA A100
✅ Storage volumes mounted correctly

📊 Basic Environment: 6/6 passed

🏗️  VALIDATING PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE
✅ Coordination Engine: Healthy
✅ Coordination Engine Metrics: Operational
✅ KServe Proxy: Connected
✅ Model Serving: anomaly-detector READY
✅ Object Storage: S3 accessible
✅ MCP Server: Running

📊 Platform Infrastructure: 12/12 passed
```

### Understanding the Results

The validation notebook generates a comprehensive report showing:
- ✅ **PASSED**: Component is ready
- ⚠️ **WARNING**: Component works but may need attention
- ❌ **FAILED**: Component needs fixing before proceeding

**Common Issues and Fixes:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| GPU not available | Verify GPU operator is installed: `oc get csv -n openshift-operators \| grep gpu-operator` |
| Storage volumes not mounted | Check PVC status: `oc get pvc -n self-healing-platform` |
| Coordination Engine unreachable | Verify service: `oc get svc coordination-engine -n self-healing-platform` |
| Prometheus not accessible | Check Prometheus operator: `oc get pods -n openshift-monitoring \| grep prometheus` |

## Step 3: Understand KServe Model Onboarding

KServe is the model serving infrastructure that powers the platform's ML predictions. Let's explore how models are registered and used.

### Open the KServe Onboarding Notebook

1. Navigate to `notebooks/00-setup/`
2. Open `01-kserve-model-onboarding.ipynb`

### Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│  Notebook   │────▶│ Coordination Engine  │────▶│ KServe Inference    │
│  (Python)   │     │ (Go Service)         │     │ Services            │
│             │     │ /api/v1/detect       │     │                     │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
```

> **💡 Language Note**: The notebooks you'll work with are **Python** (for ML/data science), but they interact with production services written in **Go**:
> - **Coordination Engine**: Go service (orchestrates remediation, proxies to KServe)
> - **MCP Server**: Go service (connects Lightspeed to cluster tools)
> - **Notebooks**: Python (train models, analyze data, call Go services via REST APIs)
>
> This separation allows Python for ML workflows while Go handles production performance and Kubernetes integration.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Central orchestration for all ML models
- ✅ Config-driven model registration
- ✅ No code changes to add new models
- ✅ GitOps-native workflow

### Discover Available Models

The notebook shows you how to use Python to call the Go-based Coordination Engine via its REST API:

1. **Connect to Coordination Engine** (Python client calling Go service):
   ```python
   from coordination_engine_client import get_client
   client = get_client()  # Connects to http://coordination-engine:8080 (Go service)
   ```

2. **List Available Models**:
   ```python
   models = client.list_models()
   for model in models:
       print(f"{model.name}: {model.status}")
   ```

3. **Check Model Health**:
   ```python
   health = client.get_model_health("anomaly-detector")
   print(f"Status: {health.status}")
   print(f"Ready: {health.ready}")
   ```

### Test a Model Prediction

```python
# Example: Detect anomaly in sample metrics
response = client.detect_anomaly(
    metrics={
        "cpu_usage": 0.95,  # 95% CPU
        "memory_usage": 0.88,  # 88% memory
        "pod_restarts": 5
    }
)

print(f"Anomaly detected: {response.is_anomaly}")
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence}")
print(f"Severity: {response.severity}")
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Environment Setup

The environment setup notebook (`environment-setup.ipynb`) validates your Python environment and installs any missing dependencies.

### Run Environment Setup

1. Open `notebooks/00-setup/environment-setup.ipynb`
2. Execute all cells
3. The notebook will:
   - Check Python version (3.11+)
   - Verify required packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)
   - Install missing dependencies
   - Validate GPU access (if available)
   - Test connectivity to platform services

### Expected Output

```
✅ Python 3.11.0 detected
✅ Required packages installed:
   - pandas 2.1.0
   - numpy 1.24.0
   - scikit-learn 1.3.0
   - torch 2.1.0
✅ GPU available: NVIDIA A100 (40GB)
✅ Coordination Engine: http://coordination-engine:8080
✅ Prometheus: http://prometheus-k8s:9090
✅ Object Storage: S3 endpoint accessible
```
